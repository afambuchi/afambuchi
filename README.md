- 👋 Hi, I’m Chi Onabolu
- 👾 I work as a Drupal Web Developer and aim to be a full-stack developer
- 👀 I’m interested in working on projects to build a portfolio
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to solidify my Python, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, and React ( and of course Drupal)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any website projects and basic coding games

My current project is a personal portfolio to showcase my current projects and resume.
